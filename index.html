        <h2>Introduction to JavaScript's Document Object Model.</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the
          objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the
          web. This guide will introduce the DOM, look at how the DOM represents
          an HTML document in memory and how to use APIs to create web content
          and applications.

        <h2>What's DOM?</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
          documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the
          document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the
          document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can
          interact with the page. A web page is a document that can be either
          displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases,
          it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM)
          representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented
          representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting
          language such as JavaScript.

        <h2>DOM and JavaScript.</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
          The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript
          language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML
          documents, SVG documents, and their component parts. The document as a
          whole, the head, tables within the document, table headers, text
          within the table cells, and all other elements in a document are parts
          of the document object model for that document. They can all be
          accessed and manipulated using the DOM and a scripting language like
          JavaScript. The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is
          instead a Web API used to build websites. JavaScript can also be used
          in other contexts. For example, Node.js runs JavaScript programs on a
          computer, but provides a different set of APIs, and the DOM API is not
          a core part of the Node.js runtime. The DOM was designed to be
          independent of any particular programming language, making the
          structural representation of the document available from a single,
          consistent API. Even if most web developers will only use the DOM
          through JavaScript, implementations of the DOM can be built for any
          language.

        <h2>How to access the DOM?</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
          You don't have to install anything additional, just JavaScript will
          do. We have a few methods called 'selectors', these methods are used
          to access DOM elements and are found on the global 'document' object, which is an object representation of the whole HTML document. Here are <strong>some</strong> of them:
          <ul>
            <li>document.querySelector('cssSelectorHere')</li>
            <li>document.getElementById('elementsIdHere')</li>
            <li>document.getElementsByClassName('classNameHere')</li>
          </ul>
